# Discoverix Sdn Bhd

Hello I'm working as **Trainee Network Engineer** for now. I learn and Linux, DevOps, Infra and Markdown documentation.

During my free time, my target is to learn some web development such as **Django-Framework**, **JavaScript**, **MongoDB**, **FastAPI**, **Docker** and **Penetration Testing**.

This is my personal log what I've learn so far during working at Discoverix Sdn Bhd. Writing here so I don't forget.
