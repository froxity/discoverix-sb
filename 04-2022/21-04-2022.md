## What I Learn üìö

1. Docker üê≥
   - Stopping & Restaring Containers
     - `docker ps --help`
       - show containers
     - restart docker
       - `docker ps -a` > `docker start <names>`
   - Understanding Attached & Detached Containers
     - `docker start <names>`, NOT blocking terminal (Detached Mode default)
     - `docker run -p <our port:app port> key`, blocking terminal (Attached Mode default)
       - attached means, we're listening to the output of that container
   - By default, if you run a Container without `-d`, you run in "attached mode"
     - If you started a container in detached mode (i.e. with -`d`), you can still attach to it afterwards without restarting the Container with the following command:
       - `docker attach CONTAINER`, attaches you to a running Container with an ID or name of `CONTAINER`.
   - `docker run -i`, interactive, keep STDIN open even if not attached (espcially Python)
   - `docker image inspect <id>`
   - Copy Files into & from a container
     - `docker cp <local> <docker dir>` or `docker cp <docker dir> <local>`
     - we can put specific path to file or whole directory to copy
   - Naming & Tagging Containers and Images
     - `docker run -p <our port:app port> -d --rm --name <tag_name> <key>`
       - use for naming alias to easy remember for stop the docker or start
     - Images
       - `FROM name:tag`
       - name: defines a group of possible more specialized, images (node)
       - tag: defines a specialized image within a group of images (14)
       - also when building images `docker build -t <name>:<tag>`
   - Sharing Images and Containers
     - can share **Dockerfile**
       - simply run `docker build .`
     - can share **Built Image**
       - Download an image run a container based on it.

    ‚ö† <b>REMINDER:</b>
    <br>
    <p>The Dockerfile instructions might need surrounding files/folders (e.g. source code)</p>
</div>

- Pushing Images to:
  - Docker HUb
    - Official Docker image registry
    - public, private & "official" images
  - Private Registry
    - any provider / registry we want to use
    - only our own (or team) Images
  - Share : `docker push <image_name>`
  - Use: `docker pull <image_name>`
  - Login into docker cli: `docker login`, before pushing into docker hub repo

### Cheet Sheet Images & Containers - Docker üê≥

#### Images

- Images are **one of the two core building blocks** Docker is all about (the other one is
  "Containers").

- Images are **blueprints / templates** for containers. They are **read-only** and contain the
  application as well as the necessary application environment (operating system, runtimes, tools,
  ...).

- Images **do not run themselves**, instead, they can be executed as containers.

- Images are **either pre-built** (e.g. official Images you find on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/)) or you build **your own** Images by defining a **Dockerfile**.

- Dockerfiles contain **instructions** which are executed when an image is built (`docker build . `), every instruction then creates a **layer** in the image. Layers are used to **efficiently rebuild** and
  share images.

- The `CMD` instruction is special: It's **not executed when the image is built** but when a container is created and started based on that image.

#### Containers

- Containers are the **other key building block** Docker is all about.

- Containers are **running instances of Images**. When you create a container (via docker run ), a thin **read-write layer** is added on top of the Image.

- **Multiple Containers can therefore be started based on one and the same Image**. All Containers run in **isolation**, i.e. they don't share any application state or written data

- You need to create and start a Container to start the application which is inside of a Container. So it's Containers which are in the end executed - both in **development and production**

#### Key Docker Commands

For a full list of all commands, add` --help` after a command - e.g.` docker --help` , `docker run --help` etc

Full documentation [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/).

- `docker build .` : Build a Dockerfile and create your own Image based on the file

  - `t NAME:TAG` : Assign a `NAME` and a `TAG` to an image

- `docker run IMAGE_NAME` : Create and start a new container based on image IMAGENAME (or use the image id)

  - `--name NAME` : Assign a `NAME` to the container. The name can be used for stopping and removing etc.
  - `-d` : Run the container in **detached** mode - i.e. output printed by the container is not visible, the command prompt / terminal does NOT wait for the container to stop
  - `-it` : Run the container in "**interactive**" mode - the container / application is then prepared to receive input via the command prompt / terminal. You can stop the container with `CTRL + C` when using the `-it` flag
  - `--rm` : Automatically **remove** the container when it's stopped

- `docker ps` : **List** all **running** containers

  - `-a` : **List** all containers - including **stopped** ones

- `docker images` : **List** all **locally stored images**

- `docker rm CONTAINER` : **Remove** a container with name `CONTAINER` (you can also use the container id)

- `docker rmi IMAGE` : **Remove** an image by name / id

- `docker container prune` : **Remove** all **stopped** containers

- `docker image prune` : **Remove** all **dangling** images (untagged images)

  - `-a` : **Remove** all **locally stored** images

- `docker push IMAGE` : **Push** an image **to DockerHub** (or another registry) - the image name/tag must include the repository name/ url

- `docker pull IMAGE` : **Pull** (download) an image **from DockerHub** (or another registry) - this is done automatically if you just _`docker run IMAGE`_ and the image wasn't pulled before.
