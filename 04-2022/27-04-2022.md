## ![Docker](https://img.shields.io/badge/Docker-2CA5E0?style=for-the-badge&logo=docker&logoColor=white) (Summary)

### Docker Core Concepts

Containers:

- Read-write layer on top of image
  - Isolated
  - Single-task-focused
  - Shareable, reproducible
  - Stateless (+ volumes)
    Images
- Created with instructions (layers)
  - Blueprints for Containers
  - Code + environment
  - Read-only / does not run
  - Can be build + shared

### Key Commands

Build an image based on a Dockerfile

```
docker build -t NAME:TAG .
```

> `-t NAME:TAG` : Name of versions of an images  
> `.` : Build context

Run a container based on a remote or local Image

```
docker run --name NAME --rm -d IMAGE
```

> `--name NAME` : Container name  
> `--rm` : Remove once stopped  
> `-d` : Detached mode

Share (push) and Image to a Registry (default:DockerHub)

```
docker push REPOSITORY/NAME:TAG
```

Fetch (pull) an Image from a Registry (default:DockerHub)

```
docker pull REPOSITORY/NAME:TAG
```

### Docker Containers & Data

Containers are isolated and stateless.

Isolated

- Containers have their own data and filesystem, detached from the host machine filesystem

  - Use **Bind Mounts** to connect host machine folders
  - `-v /local/path:/container/path`

Stateless

- They can store data internally, but data will be lost if the container is removed and replaced by a new one

  - Use **Volumes** to persist data
  - `-v NAME:/container/path`

### Docker vs Docker Compose

Repeating long `docker build` and `docker run` commands get annoying - especially when working with **multiple containers**.

Docker Compose allos you to pre-define build and run configuration in a `.yaml` file.

> `docker-compose up` : Build missing images and start all containers  
> `docker-compose down` : Stop all started containers

### Local Host (Development) vs Remote Host (Production)

| Local host / Development                                      | Remote Host / Production                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Isolated, encapsulated, reproducible development environments | Isolated, encapsulated, reproducibleenvironments                     |
| No dependency or software clashes                             | Easy updates: Simply replace a running container with an updated one |

> Develop your application in the same environment you'll run it in after deployment

### Deployment is Optional

It's perfectly fine to use Docker (and Docker Compose) for local development!

- Encapsulated environments for different projects
- No global installation of tools
- Easy to share and re-produce

### Deployment Considerations

1. Replace **Bind Mounts** with **Volumes** or **COPY**
2. Multiple containers might need **multiple hosts** - but they can also run on the **same host** (depends on application)
3. **Multi-stage build** help with apps that need a **build step**

Control vs Ease-of-use

| Control                                                                | Ease-of-use                                                                      |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| You can launch a remote server, install Docker and run your containers | You can use a managed service instead                                            |
| Full control but you also need to manage everything                    | Less control and extra knowledge required but easier to use, less responsibility |

### What is Kubernetes?

According to their own [website](https://kubernetes.io/), Kubernetes is an **open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.**

This means that Kubernetes is a collection of tools / services and concepts that help you **deploy containerized applications** - typically across multiple hosts (i.e. multiple remote machines).

Kubernetes **simplifies** the deployment and configuration of complex containerized applications and it helps with topics like scaling and load balancing.

Services like [AWS ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs) also help with that but of course you **have to follow the AWS-specific rules**, syntax and logic / concepts for that. To a certain extent, you are "locked in" - if you want to switch to a different provider / host, you have to "translate" all your deployment configs etc.

With Kubernetes, you can set up a configuration (following the Kubernetes rules and concepts) which will **work on any host** that supports Kubernetes - no matter if it's a cloud provider or your own, Kubernetes-configured data center.

<br>

### How does Kubernetes work?

We'll dive into the specific and concret examples later (in the next section), but generally, you can **run a couple of commands against a Kubernetes Cluster** (a network of machines which are configured to support Kubernetes) to then deploy and start Containers.

Typically, you will write down **Kubernetes configuration files which describe your target state**

- with a couple of Kubernetes commands, you can then bring that state to life on your cluster.

Here's an example configuration file:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
    name: users-deployment
spec:
    replicas: 2
    selector:
        matchLabels:
            app: users
    template:
        metadata:
            labels:
                app: nginx
    spec:
        containers:
            - name: users
            image: my-repo/users-application
```

<br>

### Why Kubernetes

If your projects and hence your deployments become **more complex** (multiple Containers, scaling, load balancing), you probably don't want to run and monitor all your containers on your remote machines manually.

You might not want to do this for various reasons - also see the "Deployment" section, earlier in the course.

**Kubernetes makes setting up and configuring complex deployments easy**. It will also automatically monitor your containers and restart them if they go down. It makes scaling and load balancing easy (as it's built-in).

Managing data in **volumes** across multiple machines is also easy to set up. And much more. For all these reasons, you might want to use Kubernetes.

As mentioned above already, you **could also use any other managed Container service** (e.g. AWS ECS) but you would then be kind of "**locked in**". With Kubernetes, you indeed use a open- source "tool" and you can use your Kubernetes configuration on any machine and any provider which supports Kubernetes.

### What Kubernetes is NOT!

It's important to understand that Kubernetes is **NOT** one of the following things:

- a cloud provider
  - a cloud provider service (though cloud provider might offer Kubernetes-specific services)
    - a tool or service that manages infrastructure - Kubernetes will NOT create and launch any machines or do anything like that (managed Kubernetes services by cloud providers might do that)
      - a single tool or software - Kubernetes is a collection of concepts and tools (see below)

### Core Concepts

Kubernetes is a collection of concepts and tools.

Specifically, a **Kubernetes Cluster** is required to run your Containers on. A Kubernetes Cluster is simply a **network of machines**.

These machines are called "**Nodes**" in the Kubernetes world - and there are two kinds of Nodes:

- The **Master Node**: Hosts the "**Control Plane**" - i.e. it's the control center which manages your deployed resources
  - **Worker Nodes**: Machines where the actual Containers are running on

The Master Node hosts a couple of "tools" / processes:

- An **API Server**: Responsible for communicating with the Worker Nodes (e.g. to launch a new Container)
  - A **Scheduler**: Responsible for managing the Containers, e.g. determine on which Node to launch a new Container
    - A couple of other things, also see the [official docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/)

# What I Do üíª

Craete 2 commands to delete the mongodb log

Removing the `mongod.log.<swap_date_time_utc>` file according to year and month and another to year:

- Year and month

```bash
~$ sudo find . -name "mongod.log.<YYYY-MM>-*" | xargs sudo rm
```

- Year

```bash
~$ sudo find . -name "mongod.log.<YYYY>-*" | xargs sudo rm
```

Reminder: Before puting pipe `xargs sudo rm`, ensure the output for `find` command get the result what you want to delete it first.

Note: `<YYYY-MM>` replace with YYYY-MM of your choice. For example, `2022-01` and for `<YYYY>`, replace with YYYY of your choice, for example, `2022`.
