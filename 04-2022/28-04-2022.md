# What I Learn 📚

## Linux 🐧

### CHMOD 644

Permissions of `644` mean that the

- **owner** of the file has **READ and WRITE access**.
- **group members** and other users on the system only have **READ access**.

Diff. between 744 and 644

| chmod 744                          | chmod 644                     |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Owner can READ, WRITE, **EXECUTE** | Owner can READ, WRITE         |
| Group & others can READ only       | G roup & others can READ only |

### TAR

```bash
~$ sudo tar -zcvf /home/<username>/temp/<timestamp>_access_log.tar.gz -C /home/appuser/docker/sg_ai_app/volumes/sg_ai_fe/logs/ $(cd /home/appuser/docker/sg_ai_app/volumes/sg_ai_fe/logs/ && ls <timestamp>*_access.log)
```

```bash
~$ sudo tar -zcvf <directory_tar_output/filename.tar.gz> -C <working_directory> <list_of_file_we_want_to_compile>
```

Note:

> `directory_tar_output/filename.tar.gz` : Directory to output the tar file location  
> `<working_directory>` : Directory where's the file we want to compile.  
> `<list_of_file_we_want_to_compile>` : We can use command substititon for getting the list
>
> It turns out, $() is called a command substitution. The command in between $() or backticks (“) is run and the output replaces $(). It can also be described as executing a command inside of another command.

For example: `$(cd /home/appuser/docker/sg_ai_app/volumes/sg_ai_fe/logs/ && ls <timestamp>*_access.log))`
